# Quiz 1

## Solve the quiz

**Do not rename the sql files as they a graded automatically.**

Answers to the SQL questions should be entered into the `.sql` files. The autograder uses PostgreSQL ([https://www.postgresql.org/](https://www.postgresql.org/)). The answers to the remaining parts should be submitted as a scan (pdf) or word or latex doc.

The file `quiz1.sql` contains SQL code for generating the schema and loading the test data.

## Prepare and upload solutions

To upload your solution to diderot, create a single archive named `handin.tgz` containing all of your files. You can use the makefile in this directory to do that:

```sh
make
```

Once you have a `handin.tgz` file, you can upload it through diderot's webinterface. After the autograder is done it will provide you with feedback about your solutions. That is, it will tell you how your query results differ from the expected query results. The parts that are not autograded will be graded by the TAs later.
